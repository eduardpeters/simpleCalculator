# Simple Calculator

This is a calculator developed as a project during the Full Stack Bootcamp at The Bridge.

It is written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS as one of the early projects, allowing me to become familiar with how these three technologies come together to build a nice and useful client side application.

### Features

- It supports both UI buttons and keyboard input.
- Decimal numbers input.
- Can switch the sign of input number.
- Sum, substraction, multiplication and divition.
- Operations can be chained one after the other.
- Operation can be changed before next number input.
- An All Clear button ("c" on the keyboard) resets the calculator.
